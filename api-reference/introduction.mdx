## Authentication

All interactions with GoodSpace AI’s APIs require authenticated access. We use Bearer tokens for secure API calls, ensuring that only authorized users can access the services. Here’s how our security scheme is defined in the API documentation:

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": {
      "type": "http",
      "scheme": "bearer",
      "bearerFormat": "JWT"
    }
  }
]
```
